Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of labeled training data that can be used to fine-tune machine learning models. The format is optimized for training and is in the JSON Lines (JSONL) format, where each line represents a single training instance.

File Format

Each line of the dataset is a valid JSON object containing a training example. The typical structure of each entry may look like this:

```json
{"input": "What is the capital of France?", "output": "Paris"}
